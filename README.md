#  Navigation List Selection Background

A little example project to demonstrate how to highlight list rows in a `NavigationStack`.


## Goal

A List of NavigationLinks in a NavigationStack. The expected behaviour is to highlight the row of the selected NavigationLink and only remove the highlight when the destination view is popped from the stack.
